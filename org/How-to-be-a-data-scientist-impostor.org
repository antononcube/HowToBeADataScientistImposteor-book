* How to be a data scientist impostor? [%] [/]
** TODO Introduction [0%] [0/6]
*** TODO Mission statement
- The purpose of this book is to give an overview and examples of different philosophical, mathematical, and software programming techniques that would allow the reader to practice Data Science.
*** TODO Exposition plan
1) We start with Data Science market diagnosis and general strategies for problem solving.
2) Then we proceed with didactic chapters for:
   - doing data analysis, and
   - explanations of fundamental Machine Learning (ML) algorithms.
3) Then we give practical know-how for tackling certain ML problems variations of which often occur.
4) Finally, we show some "shock and awe" projects.
*** TODO Who is the intended reader?
- This book is for the smart and audacious. (Definitely not for dummies...)
- The reader is expected to have at least one fairly well developed relevant skill. 
  - Like the following.
    - Programming ability.
    - Mathematical maturity and reasoning ability.
    - Mathematical modeling abilities.
      - Ability to express processes in equations and formulas.
    - Systems operations knowledge.
    - Strong Physics or Physical sciences engineering background.
      - Like Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Chemical Engineering ...
      - Software Engineering does not count here.
- We assume the reader is inquisitive and willing to jump into the water without knowing how to swim.
