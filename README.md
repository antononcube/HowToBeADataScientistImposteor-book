# "How to be a data scientist impostor?" book

This repository has chapters, code, and organizational materials for the book "How to be a data scientist impostor?"

## Mission statement

The purpose of this book is to give an overview and examples of different philosophical, mathematical, and software programming techniques that would allow the reader to practice Data Science.

## Exposition plan

1. We start with Data Science market diagnosis and general strategies for problem solving.

2. Then we proceed with didactic chapters for:

    - doing data analysis, and
    
    - explanations of fundamental Machine Learning (ML) algorithms.
    
3. Then we give practical know-how for tackling certain ML problems. 
   Variations of those problems often occur in "real life."

4. Finally, we show some "shock and awe" projects.

See this [mind-map](https://github.com/antononcube/HowToBeADataScientistImpostor-book/blob/master/org/How-to-be-a-data-scientist-impostor-mind-map.pdf)

for more detailed order of books parts and chapters.

Generally speaking, I am very interested in comparison of the abilities of theories, methodologies, programming languages, 
algorithms, and concrete implementations to solve problems encountered in practice. This book presents
a fair amount of such comparisons. 

Almost all code is available in *both* Mathematica (Wolfram Language) and R.

## Who is the intended reader?

This book is for the smart and audacious. (Definitely not for dummies…)

The reader is expected to have at least one fairly well developed relevant skill.
Like the following.
  
   - Programming ability.
   - Mathematical maturity and reasoning abilities.
   - Mathematical modeling abilities.
   - Ability to express processes through equations and formulas.
   - Systems operations knowledge.
   - Strong Physics or Physical Sciences engineering background.
      - Like Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Chemical Engineering …
      - (Software Engineering does not count here.)

We assume the reader is inquisitive and willing to jump into the water without knowing how to swim.

## Code and related repositories

The programming languages used are Wolfram Language (WL) and R.
(Wolfram Language and Mathematica are used as synonyms in this book.)

Most of the practical ML know-how projects are projects from 
[MathematicaVsR at GitHub](https://github.com/antononcube/MathematicaVsR). 

Many of the chapters were previously published in 
[MathematicaForPrediction at WordPress](http://mathematicaforprediction.wordpress.com)
