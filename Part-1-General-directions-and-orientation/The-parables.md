# The parables

The following parables illustrate some important "dos and don'ts" in Data Science. 
(There is a strong evidence that some of them apply elsewhere...)

## Teaching the son of the shah 

*(Read long time ago in \[1\].)*

A shah asked his wise-men to teach his son their sciences.

After a few years the shah wanted to make an examination in order to see what his son has learned.

He called for his son and his teachers and asked them to bring their tools of trade.

When they arrived the shah told them that he is going to examine what his son has learned. 
Without anyone noticing the shah took one of his rings in his fist and put both of his hands behind his back.
The shah asked his son to guess correctly what is the shah holding.

Shah's son started doing calculations using a chalkboard and also started drawing shapes in a box of sand.
That took some time and shah's son was clicking his tongue and rolling his eyes while doing it.
After awhile a circular shape was drawn in the box of sand and shah's son said he has finished.

The shah said: "Well that is good, but that circular shape has to be named. What is it?"

Shah's son said: "Father, I am not clairvoyant or foreseer. How could I know!? I guess you are holding a griding stone."

The shah angrily turned to the wise-men and told them: "You have taught him wrong!"

One of the wise-men said: "No, we taught him right. But one has to be smart enough to figure out that you
are holding a ring in your hand, and could not hold a grinding stone."  

### Morals

Very often data scientists rely on procedure too much.
Meaning, they just repeat the procedures they were taught without serious considerations of prerequisites,
applicability, and appropriate conclusions. Much of the procedures are mechanical, but interpreting the 
results in real life requires certain domain knowledge and common sense.  

A few elements of this parable are also important. 
Notice that shah's son said that he is finished after he finished the calculations, not after making 
a guess based on the calculations result. Some data scientist have similar timing of declaring victory;
but from the perspectives of projects stakeholders the finishing of the calculations is just the beginning...  

## Marriage instead of dept pay

TBD...

### Morals

In sufficiently many situations:
 
- rapid scenarios play-out is extremely beneficial,

- one can find more effective solutions outside of the obvious plane derived by some dichotomy (like right-wrong or fair-unfair), 
 
- it is better to utilize "the system" against itself, 
  especially when direct confrontation is not going to produce good outcomes.

 
## The big rocks in the jar

See the 5 minutes long movie ["Big Rocks"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FbWb3f-jLQ).

If you cannot or do not want to see the movie here is a short version.

Assume that 

- you have an empty jar,

- a set of big rocks, a set of stones (smaller rocks), sand, and

- for some reason you want to put all the rocks and sand in the jar.

Then 

- you put in the jar the big rocks first,

- then you put the smaller rocks, and

- finally the sand.

If you try any other order of those actions you won't have the maximum possible amount of rocks, stones, and sand in the jar. 

### Morals

Trivial parable but the expression "the big rocks" is used a lot and often by managers in order to describe
triage and priority of tasks.
