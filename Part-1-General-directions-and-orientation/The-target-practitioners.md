# The target practitioners

This book targets the following four archetypes of Data Science practitioners.

## Simple Nuclear Physicist (SNP)

The first archetype is the "Simple Nuclear Physicist" (SNP) -- 
someone who is accustomed to obtaining a lot of data that has to be analyzed and mined sometimes 
very deeply, rigorously, and from a lot of angles, for different confirmation and rejection of different 
hypotheses and conjectures.
 
SNP is fairly adept in programming and critical thinking, 
but he does not have or care about deep knowledge of statistical methods or machine learning algorithms.
 
SNP is willing and capable to use software libraries that provide algorithms for statistical methods and machine learning.

## Common Operations Research Analyst (CORA)

This guy is shared by different departments in some large company like 
Big Amusement Parks Corporation or Large Vacation Cruises Company. 
CORA is an internal consultant providing different kinds of decision support for different types of stakeholders. 

In the Large Vacation Cruises Company CORA is responsible for ships routes design and rerouting, 
price elasticity models for vacation packages, products and services placement within a ship.

## Standard Machine Leaning Engineer (SMLE)

This guy is a typical ML practitioner. Uses Machine Learning tools and mindset, might be called "Data Scientist" by some.

## Pretending Typical Statistician (PTS)

This guy is a statistician branding himself as a Data Scientist (because of money and/or prestige.)
 
PTS thinks classical statistical methods are most relevant to the problems given to PTS and 
PTS is inclined to do data modeling first and then apply the usual statistical methods. 

Not as good of a programmer as the rest of the archetypes listed here.
