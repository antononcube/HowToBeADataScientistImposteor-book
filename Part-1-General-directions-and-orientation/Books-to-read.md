# Books to read

***Version 0.6***

In this chapter I list a small number of books that would provide in my opinion enough of 
general "data scientist way of thinking" and "data scientist culture" background.

I do not try to paint full pictures of the books, but I do attempt to point out features that would make
them desirable reads. 

I tried to provide a short, minimal list of books, but, of course, I did not assume that all of those books
are going to be read by the reader. 
That is why the books are given in order which reflects a certain prioritization -- 
the more engaging, important, or necessary books are given on top.  

I divided the list of books in two parts: general background, and technical background.
Ideally the reader is going to read books from both parts. The reading of the books in the technical part 
can be postponed until it is needed. I made the technical list of books mostly to give examples 
of good books from which to learn mathematical elements of Machine Learning and Data Analysis. 

## The general background books

From the perspective of becoming a data scientist the most engaging and inspiring book is "Freakonomics", [SL1]. 

Both "The Signal and the Noise", [NS1], and "Statistics done wrong", [AR1], are nice "next book" candidates.

Browsing "The Decision Book", [MK1], and learning a few of the techniques there is a must. 
(Also, keep that book handy afterwards.) 

### "Freakonomics"

Engaging, inspiring...

### "The Signal and the Noise"

The book 
["The Signal and the Noise"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Signal_and_the_Noise), [NS1],
by 
[Nate Silver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nate_Silver),
discusses in an engaging manner different topics of prediction and forecast. The game theory (gambling) 
perspective is especially useful. 
Also, the book does have a certain philosophical and epistemological point of view which I find very
useful when practicing data science. (And applied mathematics in general.)

For example, answers of the following questions are discussed.

- What makes a good forecaster?

- How can you deliver consistently good forecasts?

- What is the difference between prediction and forecast?

- How to profit in the poker bubble?

### "Statistics done wrong"
 
The book 
["Statistics done wrong"](https://www.statisticsdonewrong.com), [AR1, AR2], 
by
[Alex Reinhart](https://www.refsmmat.com)
gives a lot of useful knowledge and perspectives on how to critically apply Statistical methods.
Read this book if want to argue with statisticians.
(I read that book online first, and then bought a paper copy from Amazon.)

### "The Decision Book"

"The Decision Book", [MK1],
has a nice summary of problem representation techniques that can be used for both problem solving and communication.

For more than 25 years I have extensively used and applied the 
["Morphological Analysis"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphological_analysis_(problem-solving)) 
technique described in [MK1].

### "The Seven Pillars of Statistical Wisdom"

The book
"The Seven Pillars of Statistical Wisdom", [SS1], 
by Stephen Stigler 
provides nice historical overviews of how important concepts and ideas of Statistics
came to life and fruition. 

The book is a very good guide to how statisticians think. 
Also, it can be used to conjecture what is outside of the statistical culture of thinking. 

I do find that book enlightening enough, although I expected a larger fraction of it to be with Statistical wisdom 
than with Statistical history. (Granted, Statistical wisdom is hard to share without extensive mathematical theory
and extensive practical applications.)

(I studied Mathematics in order to learn how to make theories. 
So, generally speaking, I am a big fan of books on history of Science and Mathematics, 
because they show how the scientists and mathematicians developed, confirmed, and applied their theories.)

### "How to solve it?"

The book 
["How to solve it?"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Solve_It), [GP1],
by 
[George Pólya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Pólya),
is a classic by one of the greatest mathematicians ever!

This is a technical, mathematical book, but the methods presented in it are general enough. 

### "Skin in the Game"

The book
["Skin in the Game"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_in_the_Game_(book))
by 
[Nissim Nicholas Taleb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nassim_Nicholas_Taleb)
discusses in a provoking manner different philosophical aspects hidden asymmetries and their consequences. 
It is also to a large degree about the information sharing and risk taking involved in decision making
(by the decision makers, and their advisers.)

I am listing this book for two main reasons:

- Nasim Taleb's attitude to real life problems (using probability and statistics or not), and

- the description of the "Intellectual Yet Idiot" (IYI).

Practicing Data Science includes discussions and arguments with IYI's. Also see "Disciplined Minds" below.

### "Disciplined minds"

The book 
["Disciplined Minds"](), [JS1, JS2], 
by
[Jeff Schmidt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Schmidt_(writer))
is one my favorite books to recommend. The book discusses how the universities make the so
called "timid professionals". It focuses on Western Physics and physicists, but it also discusses how that 
brainwashings are done in other occupations and countries. "Disciplined Minds" is original, provocative, systematic, 
and it does describe many of the statisticians and data scientists I have met.

As a comparison, this book -- "How to be a Data Scientist Impostor?" -- 
is written for self-disciplined, maverick, and audacious minds.


## The technical background books

### "Matrix Methods in Data Mining and Pattern Recognition"

One of the best books I have read...

### "Guesstimation"

The book
["Guesstimation: Solving the World's Problems on the Back of a Cocktail Napkin"]
Lawrence Weinstein and John Adam discusses how to make 
["guesstimates"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guesstimate).
Making guesstimates does resemble the data scientist effort of answering "concise but open-ended" 
business problems. 

### "The Elements of Statistical Learning" 

["The Elements of Statistical Learning" (ESL)](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/), [TS1, TS2],
is a great book. (Content-wise, size-wise, and challenge-wise.) 
I expect the reader to have to read -- or need to read -- only some chapters of it.
(I.e. "read some elements of ESL".)  

### "Classification and Regression Trees"

One of the original Machine Learning monographs...

### Understanding Complex Datasets

Nice to read....
