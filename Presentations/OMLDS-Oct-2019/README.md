# First presentation: OMLDS 2019-10-05

This directory has the presentation notebook and supporting PDS's, mind-maps, and notebooks 
for 
[the presentation](https://www.meetup.com/Orlando-MLDS/events/265270120/) 
I gave at [Orldando Machine Learning and Data Science(OMLDS) Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Orlando-MLDS/)
on 2019-10-05. 

That was the first presentation for this book and its organization. 
The preparation of the presentation was very helpful to determine book's tone for its first, non-technical part, and 
to refine book's organization of topics.
